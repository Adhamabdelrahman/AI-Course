### Problem 1 : Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints out a message depending on the value of the number. If the number is positive, print "The number is positive." If the number is zero, print "The number is zero." If the number is negative, print "The number is negative." Input:

    A single integer number

Output:

    A message indicating whether the number is positive, zero, or negative

Constraints:

    The program should use an if statement to check the value of the number.
    The program should use the comparison operators (>, <, ==) to compare the value of the number to zero.
    The program should use the print function to print out the message.

`Sample Input: 42` 
`Output: The number is positive.`

### Problem 2: Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for the odd number print TIK for the even number print TAK.

Output:
   1 TIK 
   2 TAK
   3 TIK
   4 TAK
   ...
   99 TIK
   100 TAK

`Use % to know if the number is even or odd, google it for more or even better, Use perplexity.ai`
